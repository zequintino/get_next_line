Wind Waker’s signature dungeons start out simple, and build in complexity at a great pace. For example, the dungeon on Dragon Roost Isle mostly relies on the use of the grappling hook to travel across large platform gaps. But by the time I reached a late-game dungeon called the Earth Shrine, I had to use nearly every item in my satchel – including boomerangs, bombs, and hammers – together to move forward. Each room presents another crafty puzzle that requires careful observation.

But Wind Waker’s best feature is its combat, and it's still the finest of any action adventure I’ve ever played. With a reliable lock-on system and lots of offensive combat options to counter, disorient, and disarm enemies easily, plenty of great weapons, and memorable foes, fights never get repetitive over its 30-hour length. An enemy encounter can unfold in a number of ways. Link can steal treasures using a grappling hook, or stun foes with a toss of his boomerang. He can gracefully counter incoming attacks, or freeze a baddie with an ice arrow and then finish them off with a thundering smash of an oversized hammer. Of all the incarnations of Link in the 3D era of this series, the young, cartoon iteration is the most capable fighter.
